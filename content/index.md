title: Welcome!

A friend of mine told me to start a blog when I had trouble remembering some of my projects. We were having a long chat and I eventually remembered enough to talk about. He told me, for my sake, to start a blog.

That was a couple months ago, I figured I'd best get it out ready for New Year, so here it is!

My name is **Jamie Adams**, a(n aspiring) software developer. I sometimes go by "<span style="font-variant:small-caps">**regimensocial**</span>" (or if I'm lucky, just "<span style="font-variant:small-caps">**regimen**</span>") which was the name of the social media cross exercise platform I once developed for people at my school.

I finished my A Levels in 2023, and I'm taking a year out to produce and learn some hopefully really cool stuff. I don't always have a lot to show for it, which this blog should fix...

Please take a look at the **[BLOG](/blog)**.

My latest project is [Citrahold](https://www.citrahold.com), a simple way to move saves between Nintendo 3DSs and Emulators.
